Follow these steps to add SSH Keys:
1. Generate private/public RSA key pair using:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```
    You can use the defaults. The private key will be at `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and the public at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
2. Copy the public key to the server using:
    ```bash
    scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <username>@<host>:<filepath>/id_rsa.pub
    ```
3. Login to the server using:
    ```bash
    ssh <username>@<host>
    ```
4. Add the public key to the host using:
    ```bash
    cat <filepath>/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
     In case of error try changing the file permission: 
    ```bash
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
   
And... Done!
