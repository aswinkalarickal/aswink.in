This tutorial will help you to set up a Virtual Host using MAMP without using console. Follow these steps:

1. Open the file `/etc/hosts`. You will be prompted to enter your login password.
2. Navigate to line line containing `127.0.0.1 localhost` and enter the following in the next new line:
    ```text
    127.0.0.1   example.dev
    ```
3. Save the file and exit. Now you will be redirected to `127.0.0.1` when you enter `example.dev` in your browser. 
You can do this for any number of addresses. 
4. Now open the file `/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf` and navigate to the lines containing:
    ```apacheconf
    # Virtual hosts
    # Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
    ```
5. Remove the hash(#) before the line that starts with `Include` so that it looks like:
    ```apacheconf
    # Virtual hosts
    Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
    ```
6. Open the file at `/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`. 
    You can see examples of how to define Virtual Hosts. You can either edit this or add one of your own. 
    Add this configuration to define your virtual host:
    ```apacheconf
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot /Applications/MAMP/htdocs
        ServerName localhost
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot "/path/to/site"
        ServerName example.dev
    </VirtualHost>
    ```
7. Close the file and restart the servers to get into action.
8. Now if you enter the URL `http://example.dev` in your browser, 
you will be served the files at path `/path/to/site` you had entered in the configuration. 
You can add more Virtual Hosts as and when needed.

Virtual Hosts helps in making workflow easier.
